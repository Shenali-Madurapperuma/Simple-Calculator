Simple calculator



** Part 1 : Write a simple Python program that performs arithmetic operations based on the user input **


Task 1 : Get User Input

Section 1 - 
* Input Arithmetic operation
* Rseset or Termination

Section 2 -
* Input first operand
* Input second operand
* Reset or Termination


Task 2 : Implement functions that performs given arithmetic operation on the given operands and produces the result

* Arithmetic operation and the two operands as parameters
* Return the result of the arithmetic operation


Task 3 : Call the calculation function by passing user input to select_op(choice) and display the result from within the select_op(choice) function




** Part 2 : Extend the functionality of the the calculator to save and display the past results of the arithmetic operations **


Task 4 : Extend the functionality of the the code to save each executed operation in a Python List.

* Declare a list to store the previous operations
* Save the operator, operands and the results as a single string, for each operation after each calculation


Task 5 : Implement a history() function to handle operation '?'

* Display the complete saved list of operations (in the order of execution) using a new command ‘?’
